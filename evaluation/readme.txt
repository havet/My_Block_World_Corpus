The Block World - Evaluation
============================

Train/develop your translation model/system with the files in the main folder (block word corpus).

Evaluate your system with some other sentences made up from the words in this very limited domain: The Block World. You might as well add some unknown words to asure that your system treats them nicely.

In this folder you will find some example sentences to use as a test. Beware: My mother tongue is Swedish and some translations have not been checked by a native speaker. Please report any errors.

Anyhow, you will get a general idéa of the translation problems that might arise.
Enjoy!
