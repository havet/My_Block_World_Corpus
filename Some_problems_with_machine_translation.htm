<h1>Some Problems with Machine Translation (MT)</h1>
<p>You can use a synthetic test corpus to study how specific translation problems 
  are treated by different translation models or translation programs. <b>My Block 
  World Corpus</b> is such a corpus.</p>
<p>The corpus was originally built to test some differences between Swedish and English grammar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreement of articles with nouns for gender.
<li>Agreement of adjectives with nouns for gender.
<li>Agreement of possessive pronouns with nouns for gender: the translation of third person 
singular (his/hers). In Swedish there are two possibilities for those pronouns, depending 
on if the possessed thing belongs to the person in question (the subject) or to someone 
else.
<li>In modified noun phrases both the definite article and the definite suffix are used in 
Swedish, not in English. The definiteness is in this case expressed twice in Swedish.
</ul>

<p>For more information read the document: Swedish grammar for the Block World Corpus</p>

<p>I have tested to translate test sentences from the same world (domain) as the 
  Block World Corpus i.e. I have written similar test sentences (available in 
  the folder Evaluation).</p>
  
<p>When testing I discovered some other problems interesting than those I primarily wanted to test.</p>
<p><a title="Apertium - open source machine translation" href="http://www.apertium.org/" 
target="_blank">Apertium</a>, a rule based system, has a bit of a problem, for instance with 
the Swedish sentence ”<strong>ta en blå kon .</strong>” (take a blue cone).</p>
<p>Let’s first look at the translation to Danish (sv-da):</p>
<p><strong>tag en blå koen .</strong> (take a blue the cow) A cow suddenly appears in the translation in definite form: the cow!</p>
<p>Obviously, the problem is that the wrong translations is chosen. The 
so called tagger, that’s supposed to decide on part of speach and choose
 translation, believes that the Swedish word ”kon” (cone) is the 
definite form of ”ko” (cow), instead of the indefinite form of ”kon”. 
This might be possible to avoid by first writing clever rules for the 
tagger and then training it on a large Swedish corpus.</p>
<p>A correct translation of the sentence to French would be ”<strong>prenez un cône bleu .</strong>” and Apertium translates it like this to Spanish (fr-es):</p>
<p><strong>Tomad un cono azul . </strong>(This is imperative in second 
person plural i.e. you address more than one person informally, instead 
of the polite request in third person singular subjunctive to one 
person.)</p>
<p>The translation from Spanish ”<strong>Tome un cono azul .</strong> ” to French (es-fr) becomes like this:</p>
<p><strong>Il prenne un cône bleu .</strong> (”He takes a blue cone ” 
i.e. translated to third person singular subjunctive, instead of the 
polite request in second person plural to one person.)</p>
<p>Apparently, the problem is that Apertium translates to the same form 
in the target language as the form used in the source language. 
Theoretically, this could be remedied with smart transfer rules, but it 
wouldn’t be easy.</p>
<p>The very simplest statistical translation model, IBM model 1, that 
translates word for word, masters the translation of this sentence 
effortlessly:</p>
<p>[Size: 7] [Hypothesis: &lt;s&gt; <strong>tag en blå kegle .</strong> &lt;/s&gt; ] [Probability: 0.0014176820411553467]<br>
[Size: 7] [Hypothesis: &lt;s&gt; <strong>tome un cono azul .</strong> &lt;/s&gt; ] [Probability: 4.6282404855571633E-4]<br>
[Size: 7] [Hypothesis: &lt;s&gt; <strong>prenez un cône bleu .</strong> &lt;/s&gt; ] [Probability: 0.002503888182461805]</p>
<p>The statistical translation model is trained on the parallel texts 
from the Block World Corpus and uses a 3-gram language model estimated 
on the full texts from the same corpus.</p>

<p>Note: Apertium needs punctuation to treat the sentences as sentences, otherwise the 
translation gets wird. But the translation is NOT improved if correct punction 
is used (¡ tome una flecha !).</p>
