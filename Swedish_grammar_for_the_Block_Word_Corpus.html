<h1>Swedish grammar for the Block World Corpus</h1>
<p>This document is meant to give enough knowledge of Swedish grammar
 to understand the phenomena of the block world. Only differences to 
English are pointed out.</p>
<h3>Verbs</h3>
<p>In Swedish there <strong>isn’t any verb agreement based on person</strong>. This means that the first and third person present have the same form:</p>
<ul>
<li>jag <b>ställer</b> — I put</li>
<li>han/hon <b>ställer</b> — he/she puts</li>
<li>jag <b>tar</b> — I take</li>
<li>han/hon <b>tar</b> — he/she takes</li>
</ul>
<p>There is <strong>a special imperative form</strong> in Swedish. The imperative form does not have the same form as the present tense:</p>
<ul>
<li>att <b>ställa</b> — to put</li>
<li>jag <b>ställer</b> — I put</li>
<li><b>ställ!</b> — put! (imperative)</li>
<li>att <b>ta</b> — to take</li>
<li>jag <b>tar</b> — I take</li>
<li><strong>ta</strong>! — take! (imperative)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Noun phrases</h3>
<h4>Nouns</h4>
<p>Swedish <strong>nouns have grammatical gender</strong>. There are two genders: <strong>uter</strong> (common<em>)</em>, derived from earlier masculine and female genders, and <strong>neuter</strong>.
 In simplified grammars you might find the notion of n-words (uter) and 
t-words (neuter) because of the articles and suffixes used for each 
gender. Uter is overall more frequent than neuter.</p>
<p>The nouns in the corpus have the following gender and forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>uter: cirkel/cirkeln – circle</li>
<li>uter: kon/konen – cone</li>
<li>uter: pil/pilen – arrow</li>
<li>neuter: block/blocket – block</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Articles agree with nouns for gender</strong>. The indefinite article is ‘en’ for uter and ‘ett’ for neuter. The definite article is ‘den’ in uter and ‘det’ in neuter.</p>
<p>Definiteness is more complex in Swedish than in English, though. <strong>For non-modified nouns</strong> <strong>there is a definite noun suffi<em>x, </em></strong>but not any preceding definite article. (There are some exceptions, but those doesn’t apply to this corpus).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>en</strong> kon / kon<strong>en</strong> –&nbsp; a cone / the cone (utrum/common/n-word)</li>
<li><strong>ett</strong> block / block<strong>et</strong> – a block / the block (neuter/t-word)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In modified noun phrases both the definite article and the definite suffix are used.</strong> The definiteness is in this case expressed twice in Swedish.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>en röd</strong> kon / <strong>den</strong> röda kon<strong>en</strong> –&nbsp; a red cone / the red cone (utrum/common/n-word)</li>
<li><strong>ett</strong> <strong>rött</strong> block / <strong>det</strong> röda block<strong>et</strong> – a red block / the red block (neuter/t-word)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Adjectives</h4>
<p><strong>Adjectives also agree with nouns</strong>, except for 
definite modified noun phrases. The definite form of the adjective is 
traditionally called weak (as in German). The indefinite form is 
traditionally called strong, because it conveys more information (gender
 and number).</p>
<p><strong>The definite form is used after definite articles and possessive pronouns</strong><em>,</em> otherwise the indefinite form is used. <strong>It is only the indefinite form that agrees in gender with the noun.</strong> The plural forms are omitted below, as they are absent in the block world corpus (they are identical to the definite form).</p>
<ul>
<li>en<strong> röd</strong> kon / den <strong>röda</strong> konen –&nbsp; a red cone / the red cone (<strong>utrum/common/n-word</strong>)</li>
<li>ett <strong>rött</strong> block / det <strong>röda</strong> blocket – a red block / the red block (<strong>neuter/t-word</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The forms for the adjectives in the Block Word Corpus are as follows (indefinite uter, indefinite neuter, definite):</p>
<ul>
<li>blå, blått, blåa — blue</li>
<li>röd, rött, röda — red</li>
<li>grön, grönt, gröna – green</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more examples for correct noun phrases for a neuter and a uter nouns are:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>

<h3>Possessive pronouns</h3>
<p>The possessive pronouns are similar to English for all persons, except the third person singular and plural. <strong>The
 possessive pronouns agree with nouns in the same way as articles, with 
the forms ending with ‘n’ beeing the uter forms.&nbsp; </strong>The forms for the first person singular are shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jag tar <strong>min</strong> kon — I take my block (uter/common/n-word)&nbsp; [<strong>en</strong> kon – kon<strong>en</strong> – mi<strong>n</strong> kon]</li>
<li>Jag tar <strong>mitt</strong> block — I take my block (neuter/t-word) [<strong>ett</strong> block – block<strong>et</strong> – mi<strong>tt</strong> block]</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Block World domain you will have to pay attention to the 
translation of third person singular (his/hers). In Swedish there are <strong>two
 possibilities for those pronouns, depending on if the possessed thing 
belongs to the person in question (the subject) or to someone else:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hon tar <strong>sitt</strong> block — She takes her own block</li>
<li>Hon tar <strong>hennes</strong> block — She take some other woman’s block</li>
<li>Han tar <strong>sitt</strong> block — He takes his own block</li>
<li>Han tar <strong>hans</strong> block — He take some other man’s block</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t an issue if the two persons involved have different sexes,
 but English sentences like ”She takes her block” are ambiguous. It can 
mean either that she takes her own, or some other woman’s block. Anyhow,
 the standard, unmarked reading is that it is her own. You might ignore 
this issue by assuming the standard reading when possible, and the 
someone else reading when that is the only possibility, as in ”I take 
her block”, ”He takes her block” and ”She takes his block”.</p>
<p><strong>The possessive pronouns for someone’s own agree with nouns, </strong>similarly to the possessive pronouns min/mitt above. Note that the forms are identical for both men and women:<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hon tar <strong>sin</strong> kon — She takes her own cone&nbsp;(uter/common/n-word) [<strong>en</strong> kon – kon<strong>en</strong> – si<strong>n</strong> kon]</li>
<li>Han tar <strong>sin</strong> kon — He takes his own cone (uter/common/n-word)</li>
<li>Hon tar <strong>sitt</strong> block — She takes her own block&nbsp;(neuter/t-word) [<strong>ett</strong> block – block<strong>et</strong> – si<strong>tt</strong> block]</li>
<li>Han tar <strong>sitt</strong> block — He takes his own block (neuter/t-word)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, the someone-else-pronouns<strong></strong> don’t follow the pattern, as they are not inflected, what ever the gender of the noun<em>:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Hon tar <strong>hennes</strong> kon — She take some other woman’s cone (uter/common/n-word)</li>
<li>Hon tar <strong>hennes</strong> block — She take some other woman’s block (neuter/t-word)</li>
<li>Han tar <strong>hans</strong> kon — He take some other man’s cone (uter/common/n-word)</li>
<li>Han tar <strong>hans</strong> block — He take some other man’s block (neuter/t-word)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of ungrammatical phrases</h3>
<p>Below are some examples of ungrammatical constructions. Make sure that you understand what the problems are.</p>
<ul>
<li>*ett cirkel</li>
<li>*en block</li>
<li>*blocken</li>
<li>*det blocket</li>
<li>*det röd blocket</li>
<li>*en rött cirkel</li>
<li>*hon ta blocket</li>
<li>*tar blocket</li>
<li>*hon tar sin block</li>
<li>*hon tar röda blocket</li>
<li>*hon tar sitt röda blocket</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these phrases might be grammatical in other readings than in 
the Block World Corpus, for instance, ”det blocket” which can mean ”that
 block” in a demonstrative reading, with a marked intonation on <em>det</em> (demonstrative pronoun). Likewise, ”blocken” is correct plural in unmodified definite form (the blocks).</p>
